/*
    This will be a tutorial on Loops in C some short guide nothing much,
    And I am following a guide from Potrfolio Courses on YT for all of this.
    He also has a guide on solving problems in C and I will be documenting that
   too. Some prior basics are missing I might add them later on but for now
   loops and forward stuff only.

        number++;
